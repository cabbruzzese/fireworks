Fireworks is a 4th of July themed deathmatch weapons mod that uses existing assets to recreate popular fireworks. This is based on 3.21 version of the game source.

Many unused particle effects from Quake 2 form the game make an appearance with a lot of sillyness.

This is a fun one to host and works with any standard deathmatch map.

For original quake2 clients, extract the gamex86.dll to c:\quake2\fireworks and start the game with the command `game fireworks` and then start a deathmatch game.

For dedicated or console line starting use `-game fireworks -set deathmatch 1` in the command line or similar in an autoexec or other cfg file.

(_note: for shorthand "game" is the sp/multiplayer game logic. "client" is the actual client side game code. Deathmatch mods and non-total conversions usually only change "game" code so that vanilla clients can connect without issue.)
